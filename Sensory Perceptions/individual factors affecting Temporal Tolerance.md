# Individual Differences Shaping Temporal Tolerance: Age, Gender, Experience, and Training


## Age effects

Age significantly affects temporal tolerance, generally leading to a decreased ability to process rapid temporal information, a wider temporal binding window, and changes in the perception and summation of sustained stimuli, such as pain. These changes begin to appear as early as the fourth decade of life. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5385299/)

In the supplied literature age and developmental status alter multisensory temporal binding and somatosensory timing, but comprehensive lifespan norms and many specific threshold values are not reported. Evidence in children versus adults and mechanistic work on sub-second timing implicate intracortical inhibition and basal ganglia circuits as principal neural bases.

- **Developmental trajectory evidence** Sighted children (6–15 years) show wider audio–tactile temporal binding windows than age-matched visually impaired children, whereas no TBW differences were found between visually impaired and sighted adults in the reported sample, suggesting developmental reorganization in childhood rather than continuing differences into adulthood [1]. 
 
- **Temporal discrimination measures** The somatosensory temporal discrimination threshold (STDT) is conceptualized as the minimum interstimulus interval at which two successive somatosensory events are perceived as separate; detailed age-specific numeric STDT, TOJ, or SJ thresholds across infancy, adolescence, adulthood and aging are not provided in the supplied corpus and therefore cannot be stated here (insufficient evidence).  

- **Age-related TBW changes** The available developmental study reports a wider TBW in sighted children versus visually impaired children but does not provide a full lifespan curve or exact numeric TBW limits across ages [1].  

- **Neural mechanisms linked to aging and development** STDT encoding depends on intracortical inhibitory processing in primary somatosensory cortex and on basal ganglia–thalamic–cortical interactions that involve the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, implicating inhibitory cortical circuits and subcortical modulation as mechanisms that could mediate age-related changes [2].  

- **Critical periods** The pattern that visually impaired children—but not adults—differ from sighted peers in TBW suggests a sensitive developmental window during childhood when visual experience (or its absence) shapes multisensory temporal calibration, consistent with cross-modal compensation occurring earlier in development [1].

## Sensory experience

# Pain Perception
Reduced Tolerance to Sustained Heat Pain: While heat pain thresholds (the point at which pain is first felt) generally increase with age, older adults show a decreased tolerance for prolonged or sustained heat stimulation, reporting higher pain ratings after shorter durations compared to younger adults.

**Enhanced Temporal Summation of Pain**: For repetitive thermal stimuli at certain temperatures, older adults may experience enhanced temporal summation of pain (an increase in pain intensity and unpleasantness with repeated stimulation), although findings can vary depending on the specific method used
(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763416303517#:~:text=Highlights,are%20applied%20to%20the%20head.)

Vision loss and altered sensory experience produce measurable changes in tactile temporal judgments and multisensory binding, and the literature indicates cross-modal compensation rather than simple uniform worsening.

- **Blindness effects on tactile temporal processing** Congenitally blind participants show different tactile TOJ performance when limb posture is manipulated (they are less impaired by crossing the hands), indicating that visual experience shapes spatiotopic coding that affects TOJ performance [3].  

- **Blindness effects on TBW** Visually impaired children exhibited narrower audio–tactile TBWs than sighted children when stimuli originated from the same spatial location, consistent with earlier optimization of audio–tactile temporal binding after visual deprivation [1].  

- **Deafness and temporal tolerance** The supplied corpus does not include empirical data on deafness effects on temporal tolerance or TBWs (insufficient evidence). 

- **Cross-modal plasticity and recalibration** The narrower TBW in visually impaired children is interpreted as cross-modal compensation (recalibration of remaining modalities) following visual deprivation, indicating plastic re-weighting of temporal cues in childhood [1].  

- **Critical period implications** Differences seen in children but not adults imply that sensory deprivation during childhood has stronger effects on the development of temporal binding than comparable deprivation in adulthood, consistent with a developmental sensitive period for multisensory temporal calibration [1] [3].

----

## Training and expertise

Perceptual and motor practice modify temporal discrimination and action–sensory temporal coupling; neural plasticity mechanisms implicated include modulation of intracortical inhibition and task-related prediction/error signaling.

- **Perceptual and motor training effects** Somatosensory temporal discrimination thresholds (STDTs) change during motor learning tasks, indicating that temporal acuity can be modified alongside motor skill acquisition [4].  

- **Sensorimotor synchronization and TBW** Tactile cues are weighted more strongly than visual cues for sensorimotor synchronization, and the visual–tactile TBW relates to temporal accuracy of movement execution, linking multisensory temporal windows to action timing performance [5].  

- **Action demands amplify temporal signaling** When tasks require overt action, frontocentral sensorimotor networks increase prediction-error encoding for temporal deviations, implying that action context can enhance temporal sensitivity and shape learning-related plasticity [6].  

- **Cortical locus for time-order errors** Direct intracortical microstimulation of somatosensory cortex induces time-order errors that reduce with longer interstimulus intervals, showing that cortical somatosensory circuits can be sufficient loci for training-sensitive temporal biases and that interval-dependent effects are amenable to manipulation [7].  

- **Plasticity mechanisms** Training-related changes are consistent with modulation of intracortical inhibitory circuits in S1 and with basal ganglia–cortical modulation of timing, linking synaptic and network-level plasticity to observed behavioral improvements in temporal discrimination [2] [4].

----

## Clinical and neural mechanisms

Clinical conditions and identified neural systems demonstrate how altered neurotransmission and circuit-level dysfunction change temporal tolerance and discrimination.

- **Parkinson's disease** Patients with Parkinson's disease show abnormal temporal coupling between tactile perception and motor action: in one sample of 24 patients and 20 healthy controls, healthy subjects' STDT increased at 0 ms, 100 ms and 200 ms after movement onset, whereas patients OFF therapy showed increases at 0 ms and 100 ms but returned to baseline at 200 ms; levodopa (ON therapy) restored a time course more like healthy subjects, and 15 patients were assessed ON medication in that report [8]. 
 
- **Mechanistic inferences for clinical deficits** Altered STDT and movement modulation in Parkinson's disease point to disrupted basal ganglia–thalamic–cortical interactions and impaired dopaminergic modulation of temporal processing, consistent with the broader role of nigrostriatal dopamine in STDT encoding [2] [8].  

- **Distinct neural substrates for TOJ and SJ** Temporal order judgments recruit premotor and posterior parietal cortices (and dorsal premotor areas), while simultaneity judgments show specific activation in posterior insular cortex, indicating separable cortical contributions to discrimination types and therefore potentially different vulnerability profiles across disorders [9].  

- **Other disorders** The supplied corpus does not provide empirical data on temporal tolerance in dystonia, stroke, multiple sclerosis, autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, schizophrenia, or specific developmental disorders within these papers (insufficient evidence).

----

## Gender and sex differences

**Evidence Status: INSUFFICIENT**

The current literature corpus does not provide empirical data on:
- Sex or gender differences in temporal discrimination thresholds (STDT, TOJ, SJ)
- Gender effects on temporal binding windows
- Hormonal influences on temporal processing (menstrual cycle, pregnancy, hormone therapy)
- Neural correlates of sex differences in timing
- Male vs. female comparisons in any temporal tolerance measures

**Research Gap:** This represents a significant gap in the temporal tolerance literature. Future research should systematically examine potential sex differences in temporal processing, hormonal modulation effects, and whether neural mechanisms differ between males and females.

----

## Genetic and biological factors

**Evidence Status: INSUFFICIENT**

The current literature corpus does not provide empirical data on:
- Genetic polymorphisms affecting temporal discrimination
- Heritability of temporal processing abilities
- Specific gene variants (e.g., dopamine receptor genes, GABA receptor genes)
- Individual differences in neurotransmitter systems beyond clinical populations
- Brain structure variations (e.g., gray matter volume, white matter integrity) correlating with temporal thresholds

**Inferred mechanisms from clinical data:**
- Dopaminergic systems (nigrostriatal pathway) modulate STDT [2] [8]
- GABAergic intracortical inhibition in S1 contributes to temporal discrimination [2]
- Basal ganglia–thalamic–cortical circuits are critical for sub-second timing [2]

**Research Gap:** Genetic association studies, twin studies, and individual difference studies linking brain structure/chemistry to temporal tolerance are needed.

----

## Cognitive and personality factors

**Evidence Status: INSUFFICIENT**

The current literature corpus does not provide empirical data on:
- Attention capacity effects on temporal thresholds
- Working memory capacity correlations with temporal processing
- Intelligence or IQ relationships with temporal discrimination
- Personality traits (e.g., impulsivity, conscientiousness) and temporal tolerance
- Executive function contributions to temporal judgments

**Indirect evidence:**
- Tasks requiring temporal order judgments recruit additional premotor and parietal processing (higher cognitive load) compared to simultaneity judgments [9]
- Action demands amplify temporal prediction error encoding, suggesting attention/task relevance modulates temporal processing [6]

**Research Gap:** Systematic studies correlating cognitive abilities and personality dimensions with temporal tolerance measures are lacking.

----

## Open gaps and limitations

Several requested individual-difference factors lack direct empirical coverage in the supplied literature and thus cannot be specified from these papers.

- **Sex and gender effects** The supplied studies do not report sex or gender differences in temporal discrimination thresholds or TBWs, nor hormonal influences, so statements about sex differences or neuroendocrine modulation are unsupported here (insufficient evidence).  
- **Quantitative normative values** Specific numeric STDT, TOJ, SJ thresholds, TBW widths, and effect sizes across ages or populations are not reported in the provided abstracts and cannot be supplied without additional data (insufficient evidence).  
- **Genetic and personality factors** No direct data on genetic contributions, specific gene variants, or personality/IQ correlations with temporal tolerance are available in this corpus (insufficient evidence).  
- **Deafness, musical and athletic expertise** There is no direct empirical coverage in the provided papers of deafness effects, musical training, or sports expertise on temporal thresholds (insufficient evidence).  
- **Recommended next steps** Targeted lifespan studies reporting numeric thresholds and effect sizes, controlled sex-hormone investigations, genetic association work, and intervention studies (musical, athletic training) are needed to fill these gaps.

---
Temporal tolerance and temporal binding are strongly shaped by age, sensory experience, training, and subcortical–cortical inhibitory circuits. Blindness and motor learning produce measurable narrowing or modulation of temporal windows while Parkinson's disease disrupts somatosensory temporal discrimination.
