# TOJ (Temporal-Order Judgments)
TOJ judgments refer to Temporal-Order Judgments, a cognitive task in psychology and neuroscience where people decide which of two stimuli (visual, auditory, tactile) came first, measuring sensory processing speed, attention, and multisensory integration, revealing how the brain sequences events, often showing differences based on stimulus type, age, or task complexity. 

These judgments help map brain regions (like the temporo-parietal junction) and understand temporal resolution limits, revealing how we perceive the order of sounds, sights, or touches (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15698825/).

## What TOJ Judgments Reveal
* **Temporal Resolution**: The smallest time difference needed to reliably tell the order of events (Just Noticeable Difference - JND).
* **Sensory Processing**: How quickly different senses process information.
* **Multisensory Integration**: How the brain combines inputs from different senses, especially when they are close in time.
* **Neural Mechanisms**: Activation in areas like the parietal and prefrontal cortices is linked to making TOJs.
* **Cognitive Factors**: Attention shifts (like before eye movements) and aging can affect performance.
