*"Tactile cues expanded the perceived duration of subsequent stimuli, with dynamic cues having a greater effect than static ones. While no congruency effects were observed for left and right torso locations, front-back congruency enhanced time expansion. The attentional effect peaked at a 100-ms cue-target interval. We conclude that the time-expanding effects of spatial attention extend to tactile stimuli on the human torso given that time expansion follows principles known from spatial attention."* (https://doi.org/10.3758/s13414-025-03025-6)

## Notes
This can be integrated into the dynamics of trust by taking into account that the attention to tactile perception in a specific area of stimulated by an error is increase for a period of time after the error, compared to other areas.
