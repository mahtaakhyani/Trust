Measuring perceived risk in human-robot interaction (HRI) involves capturing individuals' subjective judgments about potential harm or safety related to robots. While no HRI-specific perceived risk scale is directly described in the available research, related constructs such as perceived safety and risk perception have been measured using validated questionnaires and multidimensional scales. For example, standardized measurement tools for perceived safety in robots have been developed alongside assessments of anthropomorphism, animacy, likeability, and perceived intelligence, using semantic differential scales to ensure reliability and validity  (Bartneck et al., 2009). More broadly, perceived risk is often conceptualized as a multidimensional construct including factors like exposure, susceptibility, severity, and affective response, with empirically supported subscales developed to measure these dimensions across different hazard contexts  (Walpole & Wilson, 2021; Wilson et al., 2018). These approaches emphasize the importance of affective reactions and perceived severity, which could be adapted to HRI contexts to assess how users perceive risk from robots. Additionally, careful item wording and awareness of biases are crucial for accurate measurement, as risk perception can be influenced by heuristics and subjective interpretations  (Wolff et al., 2019).
