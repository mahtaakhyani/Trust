# Factors Shaping Temporal Tolerance in General and Tactile/Error Perception


Temporal tolerance depends on neural timing windows, attention and task demands, stimulus properties, and individual factors; in touch it is shaped by somatosensory timing mechanisms, spatial receptor/position effects, and cross‑modal binding; error timing is tied to prediction errors and sensorimotor coupling.

## General factors affecting tolerance

Temporal tolerance across modalities reflects interacting neural, cognitive, individual, and stimulus-level determinants. Core timing arises from sensory integration windows and cortical/subcortical timing circuitry, while attention, experience, and stimulus predictability shift perceptual windows and discrimination performance.

| Factor | Mechanism or effect | Empirical support |
|---|---:|---|
| Neural timing windows | Millisecond-range discrimination depends on cortical inhibitory dynamics and basal ganglia–thalamic–cortical loops that set temporal integration limits | **STDT relies on intracortical S1 inhibition and basal ganglia interplay** [1] |
| Attention and cognitive load | Tasks that require order judgments recruit additional premotor and parietal processes, increasing processing demands and altering temporal decisions | **TOJ engages premotor and posterior parietal regions more than simultaneity judgments** [2] |
| Individual differences | Development, sensory experience, and training narrow or widen temporal binding windows and thresholds | **Children show wider TBW than some peers; sensory deprivation alters TBW development** [3] **and motor learning changes STDT** [4] |
| Stimulus characteristics | Intensity, interstimulus interval (ISI), complexity and predictability modulate perceived simultaneity and order | **Time‑order errors decrease with longer ISIs in cortical stimulation** [5]; **predictability and cross‑modal timing affect synchronization accuracy** [6] |

- Neural mechanisms: Somatosensory temporal discrimination threshold (STDT) is a well‑studied index of sub‑second timing and is linked to intracortical inhibitory function in S1 and modulation by nigrostriatal and basal ganglia circuits [1].  
- Attention and load: Distinguishing temporal order requires additional sensorimotor/premotor processing relative to simultaneity decisions, implying greater cognitive load that can widen effective temporal tolerance [2].  
- Individual differences: Developmental stage and sensory experience reshape temporal binding windows; visually impaired children can develop tighter audio‑tactile TBWs earlier than sighted peers, illustrating experience‑dependent tuning [3]. Training and motor learning also modify tactile temporal sensitivity [4].  
- Stimulus features: Short ISIs produce stronger time‑order errors while longer intervals reduce them; cross‑modal stimulus alignment and predictability change synchronization accuracy and perceived order [5] [6].

## Tactile specific shaping factors

Tactile temporal tolerance arises from somatosensory discrimination limits, body‑location effects, multisensory binding, and modality‑specific cortical mechanisms. Touch shows measurable STDTs, spatially dependent performance, tactile TBWs, strong tactile weighting in sensorimotor tasks, and distinct neural loci for order versus simultaneity judgments.

- Temporal discrimination thresholds in touch: The STDT indexes the minimal interval at which two tactile events are perceived as distinct and depends on S1 inhibitory circuits and basal ganglia modulation [1]. STDT values change with motor state and learning, indicating dynamic tuning during action and practice [4] [7].  

- Spatial factors and receptor density: Temporal judgments vary with stimulated body site and limb configuration; contralateral hand/foot pairs show advantages (better accuracy, faster RTs, smaller JNDs) and crossing or posture changes degrade TOJ performance, implicating both somatotopic and spatiotopic coding [8] [9].  

- Tactile temporal binding windows: The tactile TBW specifies the SOA range within which events are fused; its width varies with age, sensory experience, and whether stimuli originate from the same location, with narrower TBWs linked to more precise temporal coding [3] [6].  
- Cross‑modal interactions: Tactile cues are weighted strongly for motor timing and can dominate visual information in visual‑tactile synchronization, and multisensory stimulus configuration relative to the TBW alters which modality guides action timing [6] [3]. 
 
- Neural substrates and timing mechanisms: Primary somatosensory cortex contributes directly to time‑order biases (intracortical stimulation produces time‑order errors), while premotor and posterior parietal areas (and posterior insula for simultaneity) are differentially involved in TOJ versus SJ tasks, indicating a distributed tactile timing network [5] [2] [1].

## Error perception and temporal dynamics

Error timing in perception and action is governed by prediction errors, sensorimotor coupling, and task relevance. Temporal prediction violations modulate behavior and recruit frontal sensorimotor networks, while tactile‑motor timing coupling and disease states alter error processing timing.

- Temporal dynamics of error detection and monitoring: Deviations from expected stimulus timing produce trial‑by‑trial effects on behavior and stronger frontocentral prediction‑error signals when actions are required, indicating amplification of temporal error signals by task relevance [10].  

- Error timing in sensorimotor control: The temporal coupling between tactile inputs and motor outputs affects error detection and subsequent behavior; Parkinson’s disease alters this coupling and the time course of tactile discrimination during movement, linking basal ganglia dysfunction to impaired temporal error processing [7].  

- Time windows for error correction: Action‑relevant temporal prediction errors are encoded rapidly in frontocentral and motor networks and correlate with reaction‑time variability, suggesting a fast window for behavioral adjustments when timing expectations are violated [10].  

- Neural correlates of error timing: The provided literature demonstrates frontocentral and motor‑referenced prediction‑error signals and somatosensory cortex involvement in time‑order biases [10] [5], but contains insufficient evidence regarding classical EEG error components such as ERN and Pe in the context of tactile temporal errors.  

- Predictive coding and temporal expectations: Temporal prediction errors are preferentially encoded in motor reference frames and amplified by action demands, consistent with predictive coding accounts where the brain prioritizes task‑relevant timing deviations [10].

## Modulating factors across contexts

Task demands, learning, pathology, and methods strongly modulate measured temporal tolerance; experimental design and posture influence observed thresholds and TBWs. Effective interpretation requires accounting for these modulators.

- Task demands and complexity: Tasks requiring explicit order judgments recruit additional premotor and parietal processing and elicit stronger prediction‑error encoding under action requirements, which can widen or sharpen temporal tolerance depending on goal relevance [2] [10].  
- Learning and plasticity: Motor learning alters STDT values and the temporal coupling between sensory inputs and actions, demonstrating plasticity of tactile timing with practice [4]. Developmental changes and sensory deprivation (e.g., visual loss) produce long‑term reorganization of TBWs and multisensory timing [3].  
- Pathological conditions: Parkinson’s disease changes the temporal relationship between tactile perception and motor action and disrupts normal STDT modulation during movement, implicating dopaminergic and basal ganglia circuits in temporal tolerance deficits [7] [1].  
- Methodological considerations: Measurement methods (e.g., adaptive psi vs constant stimuli), limb posture (crossed vs uncrossed), and whether TOJ or SJ tasks are used strongly influence estimates of temporal tolerance; TOJ and SJ engage partly distinct neural processes and require different interpretive care [9] [2] [1].  

- Practical measurement notes: Adaptive methods can estimate individual TOJ sensitivity efficiently and reveal posture and sensory‑experience effects; direct cortical stimulation demonstrates that primary somatosensory activity can be sufficient to induce time‑order errors, indicating a need to consider cortical contributions when interpreting peripheral stimulation results [9] [5].
