# Stevens' Law, Personality, and Perceived Value: Interactions, Error, and Mathematical Correlations

## 1. Introduction

Stevens' power law is a foundational psychophysical model describing how perceived intensity (ψ) relates to stimulus magnitude (φ) via the equation ψ = kφ^n, where k and n are empirically determined parameters. While the law robustly models sensory perception across modalities, its integration of individual differences—such as personality traits or transient human states—remains a subject of ongoing research. Recent literature explores how factors like the Big Five personality traits, error or unpredictability in stimuli, and time delays may modulate the parameters or outcomes of Stevens' law, particularly in tactile sensation and perceived error magnitude. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews consistently show that personality traits, especially conscientiousness and neuroticism, significantly influence performance, perception, and subjective value, though direct mathematical correlations with Stevens' law parameters are less frequently quantified  (Mammadov, 2021; Bainbridge et al., 2021; Angelini, 2023; Buecker et al., 2020; Zell & Lesick, 2021; Oshio et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2023; Özoruç et al., 2025; Alderotti et al., 2022; Graham et al., 2020). The literature also highlights the need for more nuanced models that account for individual variability and contextual factors in psychophysical scaling.

## 2. Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across over 170 million research papers in Consensus, including Semantic Scholar, PubMed, and other databases. The search strategy targeted intersections of Stevens' law, psychophysical scaling, tactile sensation, error perception, time delay, and the Big Five personality traits. In total, 1,083 papers were identified, 741 were screened, 330 were deemed eligible, and the top 20 most relevant papers were included in this review.

Eight unique search groups were used, focusing on foundational theories, parameter quantification, personality integration, error and unpredictability, mathematical correlations, and critiques of Stevens' law.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Stevens' Law and Individual Differences

Stevens' law is primarily a model of average psychophysical response, but recent critiques and extensions suggest that individual differences—such as personality traits—can influence the law's parameters (k, n) or the subjective scaling of error and value  (Poulton, 1968; Graham et al., 2020). However, most empirical studies do not directly incorporate personality into the mathematical formulation of the law.

### 3.2 Personality Traits and Perceived Value

Meta-analyses show that the Big Five personality traits, especially conscientiousness and neuroticism, are robust predictors of performance and subjective value in various domains  (Mammadov, 2021; Bainbridge et al., 2021; Angelini, 2023; Buecker et al., 2020; Zell & Lesick, 2021; Oshio et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2023; Özoruç et al., 2025; Alderotti et al., 2022). For example, conscientiousness correlates positively with academic and job performance (partial r ≈ 0.19–0.35), while neuroticism shows negative associations  (Mammadov, 2021; Zell & Lesick, 2021). These traits may modulate how individuals perceive and respond to errors or unexpected stimuli, potentially affecting the scaling exponent (n) in Stevens' law, though direct mathematical correlations are rarely reported.

### 3.3 Error, Unpredictability, and Time Delay

When the stimulus is an error, unpredicted action, or involves a time delay, perceived magnitude often deviates from standard psychophysical scaling. Memory effects, such as those modeled in time-delayed systems, can amplify or attenuate perceived error, suggesting that the parameters of Stevens' law may shift under these conditions  (Santos, 2025). However, quantitative values for k and n in tactile error perception remain underreported.

### 3.4 Quantitative Parameters in Tactile Sensation

Empirical studies on tactile sensation typically report exponents (n) in Stevens' law ranging from 0.7 to 1.5, depending on the modality and context  (Poulton, 1968). However, the literature lacks systematic reporting of how these parameters vary with personality traits or in the context of error/unpredictability.

## 4. Discussion

The integration of personality and human state into Stevens' law remains an emerging area. While the Big Five traits are well-established predictors of subjective value, performance, and error perception, their direct mathematical correlation with Stevens' law parameters is not yet robustly quantified. Most studies focus on correlational analyses (e.g., r = 0.19–0.35 for conscientiousness and performance) rather than on modifying the psychophysical scaling law itself  (Mammadov, 2021; Zell & Lesick, 2021; Oshio et al., 2018). There is evidence that error, unpredictability, and time delay can alter perceived magnitude, potentially shifting the law's parameters, but these effects are more often described qualitatively or via alternative models  (Santos, 2025). The lack of systematic parameter reporting and mathematical modeling of personality effects in psychophysical scaling highlights a significant research gap.

## 5. Conclusion

Current research suggests that while Stevens' law is a powerful model for average psychophysical scaling, it does not systematically incorporate personality or human state into its parameters. The Big Five traits, especially conscientiousness and neuroticism, are robust predictors of subjective value and error perception, but direct mathematical correlations with Stevens' law parameters remain underexplored. Error, unpredictability, and time delay can modulate perceived magnitude, but quantitative modeling of these effects in the context of personality is limited.

### 5.2 Open Research Questions

Future research should focus on developing mathematical models that explicitly incorporate personality traits and human state into psychophysical scaling laws, and on quantifying how error, unpredictability, and time delay modulate these relationships.

|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **How do Big Five personality traits quantitatively modulate Stevens' law parameters in tactile perception?** | Direct quantification would enable more individualized psychophysical models and improve predictive power.|
| **What is the mathematical relationship between perceived error magnitude and personality traits under unpredictable or delayed stimuli?** | Understanding this could inform models of error processing and adaptive behavior in real-world contexts.  |
| **Can new psychophysical models be developed to integrate personality and state variables into magnitude estimation?** | Such models would address current limitations and enhance the explanatory scope of psychophysical theory. |

In summary, while Stevens' law remains a cornerstone of psychophysics, its integration with personality science and error perception is an important frontier for future research.
