# Fisher Information
Fisher information is a fundamental concept in statistics and information theory that quantifies the amount of information a random variable carries about an unknown parameter, essentially measuring how well that parameter can be estimated from data. In simpler terms, it quantifies how precisely you can estimate a "true" value based on the data you see.

 It serves as a lower bound on the variance of unbiased estimators, indicating the precision limit in parameter estimation. Fisher information is widely used across different fields, including quantum sensing, neural coding, and ecological modeling, where it helps characterize system dynamics, optimize experimental designs, and detect regime changes.

  If small changes in a parameter (like the brightness of a light) lead to large, noticeable changes in observations, the Fisher Information is high. Graphically, it is seen as the "sharpness" or curvature of a probability curve—a sharp peak means high certainty, while a flat curve means low information.
